3.1 We can see a very shaped estructure of code where there are diferent tabs for every use. We have an Elements tab with the principal code of the site we are on and all its characteristics like the "body" where we have the main, the header and the footer; the "head" that has the tittle and the links, etc. Then bellow (ELEMENTS) we have: Styles, Event Listeners, DOM breakpoints, properties and Accessibillity. In them one can change and edit the shape of the site, change the settings of accesses and more. Then adyacent to elements we have a Console, Sources, Network and Performance, but for programmer activities we are gonna focus on Elements and Console.

5.1 XHR Request its an interface implemented to making requests HTTP and HTTPS to web servers. This interface its used as a class for a client aplication who can generate as many instances as it like. This is an easy way to obtain information from an URL only reloading a part of the page. This last task can be done without interrumpting the work already made by the user.

5.2 The xhr files are the firsts being loaded because i think they are the most important data in order to reload a page (the other data its not that important).
